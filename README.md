# pycoustics
*WIP - may not work yet!*

Python module for acoustics related DSP

Dependencies: [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)

Also doesn't work like a coherent module yet - just separate functions for now. 

Expect:
- calculation of reverb time, D50, C80, ...
- derivation of impulse response from input (/excitation) and output signal
- plot Energy Decay/Relief Curve

and more!
